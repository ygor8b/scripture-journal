    <h1>Unit 1: Foundations of Scripture Study</h1>
    <p>Exegesis, Eisegesis, and the Storyline of the Book of Mormon</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This entry explores what I learned in Unit 1 of REL A 275, focusing on two main themes: the storyline of the Book of Mormon and the tools of exegesis and eisegesis. It’s helped me understand how knowing context and applying truth personally can transform how I read scripture.</p>

    <p><strong>Image:</strong> Jesus Christ visits the Americas (3 Nephi 11). This is the climax of the Book of Mormon's storyline and a key focus of our study.</p>

    <h2>Precepts and Doctrines</h2>
    <p>One major precept I took away is the importance of serious, daily scripture study. Alma 17:2 shows that diligent searching led the sons of Mosiah to strong faith. That tells me it’s not about knowing facts—it’s about being spiritually prepared. Another is the importance of <em>not comparing</em> ourselves to others and instead trusting Christ’s grace. This principle stood out in class and reminded me to focus on progress, not perfection.</p>

    <h2>Exegesis vs. Eisegesis</h2>
    <p>This unit also introduced two powerful frameworks: <strong>exegesis</strong> (understanding scripture in its original context) and <strong>eisegesis</strong> (applying scripture personally). One example I loved was Paul’s use of the word “temple.” In 1 Corinthians 3, he’s talking about the Church community. In 1 Corinthians 6, it’s our personal bodies. Knowing the difference makes both passages richer and more applicable.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Exegesis gives us a foundation. Eisegesis helps us apply it in real life. We need both to fully understand God’s word."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why This Matters to Me</h2>
    <p>What hit me hardest was the idea that <em>faith grows gradually</em>. Like Alma 32 teaches, it starts like a seed. It needs time, care, and consistency. I’ve been impatient before, but now I’m learning to trust that spiritual growth comes over time, just like a plant we nourish. This truth applies to every principle we studied this week: repentance, scripture study, grace, and testimony.</p>

    <p><strong>Image:</strong> Alma’s seed of faith growing into a tree of life. This metaphor changed how I think about my own testimony.</p>

    <h2>Personal Application</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I will use walking or commuting time to pray or ponder like Lehi did.</li>
      <li>I will stop comparing my spiritual growth to others and trust Jesus Christ’s timeline for me.</li>
      <li>I will plant the “word” in my heart by slowing down and actually <em>studying</em> the scriptures, not just reading them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This unit showed me that the Book of Mormon isn’t just ancient history. It’s alive, and it’s meant for <em>me</em>. Now, I’m excited to keep digging in—not just to understand it better, but to change my heart through it.</p>

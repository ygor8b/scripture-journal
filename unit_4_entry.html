    <h1>Unit 4: The Atonement of Jesus Christ</h1>
    <p>Understanding Grace, Redemption, and Reconciliation</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This unit helped me better understand what the Atonement of Jesus Christ really means. The Book of Mormon gave me a broader and deeper understanding of grace, redemption, and reconciliation—terms I’ve heard all my life but never truly thought through until now.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Words</h2>
    <p>We explored the terms atonement, redemption, and reconciliation. At first, I thought I knew what they meant, but now I see how rich and layered they are. The word "atonement" itself means to make one with God. Redemption is being rescued or bought back. Reconciliation is being restored to harmony with Him.</p>

    <h2>The Broad Reach of the Atonement</h2>
    <p>The Atonement doesn’t just save us from sin and death. It empowers us. I loved the idea of Jesus giving us grace not just to be forgiven but to be changed. The enabling and perfecting grace help us grow, heal, and improve. This brought hope to me in areas I’ve struggled to overcome.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "The Atonement is not just about covering our mistakes, but about transforming our nature."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Scripture Insights</h2>
    <p>From Lehi’s words in 2 Nephi 2 to King Benjamin’s talk in Mosiah 3 and Alma’s teaching in Alma 7, I saw how central the Atonement is to God’s plan. What stood out was that we don’t need to be perfect first—we receive grace to help us become sanctified. Even the conditional blessings are still rooted in grace.</p>

    <h2>Faith in a Personal Savior</h2>
    <p>President Nelson’s reminder that Jesus knows me personally made the Atonement feel more real. It’s not abstract or general—it’s specific and intimate. I felt that during the lesson, and it made me reflect on how often I take the Savior’s grace for granted.</p>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I will strive to see the Atonement not just as a backup plan, but as a daily source of strength and healing.</li>
      <li>I will use grace to keep growing, not just to be forgiven.</li>
      <li>I will focus more on my relationship with Christ, not just my checklist of obedience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This unit deepened my testimony that Jesus Christ’s Atonement is not only infinite and eternal but personal and active in my life right now.</p>
